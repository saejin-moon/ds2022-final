# future plans for the project
1. carousel for the different stages in the process (upload, filter, download)
2. order for processing (sort by column, ignore for empty val removal, conditional params, remove dups)
3. two buttons for downloading (archive vs raw) above previewing data
4. change remove dups to checkbox and consolidate endpoints
