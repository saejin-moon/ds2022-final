# future plans for the project
1. carousel for the different stages in the process (upload, filter, download)
2. order for processing (sort by column, ignore for empty val removal, conditional params, remove dups)
3. two buttons for downloading (archive vs raw) above previewing data
4. change remove dups to checkbox and consolidate endpoints
5. option to not sort the data by any column
6. fix csv file caching so you don't have to re-upload to process data again
7. change button name to "process data"
