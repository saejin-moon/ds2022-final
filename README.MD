**Executive Summary** 
A CSV (comma-separated values) file is a plain text file that stores tables of data and organizes with rows and columns. These files are important in the world of data because they are simple, universally compatible, and easy to store, transfer, and share. However, these files often contain a jumble of unorganized data that makes it hard to analyze and understand.  

Through Project GRAHAM Cracker, we hope to help data scientists clean up their files. Users will have the ability to upload their file and pick parameters that they want their data to be organized by. For example, they can select an option for the data to be organized to remove any duplicate cells. They will then be able to download the organized file in a variety of formats to use and analyze in any way they see fit. The frontend is very accessible and easy to understand, allowing anyone from a beginner coder to a seasoned data scientist to customize and organize their data. 

**System Overview**
Some concepts and tools we used includes: 
- GitHub, CSVkit, importing CSV files (from Case 3) 
- Creating an app.py, flask, and API (from Case 4) 
- Building a front end and back end (from Case 7)
